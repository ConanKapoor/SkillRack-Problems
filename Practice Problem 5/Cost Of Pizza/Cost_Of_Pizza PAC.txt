---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form class pizza inherited from circle and cooked_item.
- Form class veg_Pizza inherited from class pizza.
- Form class chik_Pizza inherited from class pizza.
- Form get_C() to input radius, print_C() to print radius and area() function to calculate area of pizza.
- Form get_K function of kitchen class and input num1 and iterate through i=0 to num1 - 1 and input ingredient name and price of ingredients.
- Form get_Cost function of kitchen class and find the price of an ingredient from it's name.
- Form get_CI function of class cookeditem and input num and iterate through i=0 to num -1 and input input ingredient name and price of ingredients.
- Form print_K function of kitchen class and iterate from i=0 to i=num-1 and print each ingredient's name and price.
- Form print_CI function of cookeditem class and iterate from i=0 to i=num-1 and print each ingredient's name and price.
- Form get_P function of pizza and call get_C() and get_CI() function inside.
- Form compute_Cost function of veg_Pizza class  to find total cost of pizza.
- Form compute_Cost function of chik_Pizza class to find total cost of pizza. 
- Form print_P function of veg_Pizza class to print Total.
- Form print_P function of chik_Pizza class to print Total.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

Cost of pizza - Total.
