ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Form get function of learning_Material class and read isbn, title, author and year.
STEP2 - Form print function of learing_Material class and print isbn and title.
STEP3 - Form class book inherited from learning_Material under public access.
STEP4 - Initialize No_Of_Pages as int in private area and initiate price as int and form get(), calc_Price() and print() function as void in public area.
                class book:public learning_Material
                {
                    int No_of_Pages;
                    public:
                        int price;
                        void get()

                            learning_Material::get();
                            cin>>No_of_Pages;
                        }
                        void calc_Price()
                        {
                            price=No_of_Pages*1;
                        }
                        void print()
                        {
                            learning_Material::print();
			    cout<<price;
                        }
                };
STEP4 - Form class CD inherited from learning_Material under public access.
STEP5 - Initialize Duration as int in private area and initiate price as int and form get(), calc_Price() and print() function as void in public area.
                class CD:public learning_Material
                {
                    int Duration;
                    public:
                        int price;
                        void get()
                        {
                            learning_Material::get();
                            cin>>Duration;
                        }
                        void calc_Price()
                        {
                            price=Duration*2;
                        }
                        void print()
                        {
                            learning_Material::print();
                            cout<<price;
                        }
                };
