Input for the problem:-

1)Type of application (0 for arts student and 1 for engineering student).
2)Name of student.
3)Age.
4)Marks scored in English.
5)Marks scored in Second Language.
6)Marks scored in Maths.
7)Marks scored in Physics.
8)Marks scored in Chemistry.
9)Marks scored in Computer Science.
10)Marks scored in entrance exam (only for engineering student).
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form a class student_details in which initiate Name of length 20 as char and Age,English,SecondLanguage,Maths,Physics,Chemistry and ComputerScience as int under protected access specifier.

- In public area, Initialize get() function.

- Form engg_Appln class inherited from student_details class and in private area initiate cut_off as float and entrance_Marks as int.

- In public area initialize get(), Calc_Cutoff() and print() function with return type as void

- Form arts_Appln class inherited from student_details class and in private area initiate cut_off as float.

- In public area initialize get(), Calc_Cutoff() and print() function with return type as void.

- Form student_details::get() function and read Name, Age, English, SecondLanguage, Maths, Physics, chemistry and ComputerScience data.

- Form arts_Appln::get() function to read Name, Age, English, SecondLanguage, Maths, Physics, chemistry and ComputerScience data by just calling student_details::get() function.

- Form engg_Appln::get() function to read Name, Age, English, SecondLanguage, Maths, Physics, chemistry ,ComputerScience and enterance_marks data by just calling student_details::get() function and reading entrance_Marks.

- Form calc_Cutoff of arts_Appln class and compute cut_Off.

- Form calc_Cutoff of engg_Appln class and compute cut_Off.

- Form print function of arts_Appln class and print Name, fixed and cut_off rounded to 2 places by use of setprecision command of iomanip library.

- Form print function of engg_Appln class and print Name, fixed and cut_off rounded to 2 places by use of setprecision command of iomanip library.

------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1)Name of student.
2)Cutoff marks.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

By forming the function in class only rather than making outside.
