Input for the problem:-

1) Weight of black coin.
2) Current row position of coin.
3) Current column position of coin.
4) Number of moves made by black coin.
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form get function of coin class and read weight, curr_X and curr_Y.
- Form print function of coin class and print weight.
- Form get_Curr_X function of coin class and return curr_X.
- Form get_Curr_Y function of coin class and return curr_Y.
- Form get_Weight function of coin class and return weight.
- Form black_Coin function inherited from coin class and initialize no_Of_Moves as
int under private access and form get() and print() function as void under public access.
- Form gained_Power() function as bool and if no_Of_Moves>=5, return true, otherwise, return false.
- Form a move function as void to show all possible moves.
- Form red_Coin function inherited from coin class and initialize curr_X and curr_Y 
as int under private access and form print() and set_Curr_Pos_Wt() function as void under public access.
- Form a move function as void to show all possible moves.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1) Weight of black coin.
2) List of possible next positions.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-

By forming each function out of class.
