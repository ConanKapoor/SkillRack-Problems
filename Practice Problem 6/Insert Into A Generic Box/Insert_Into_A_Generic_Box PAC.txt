Input for the problem:-

1) Choice for type of element (1 for int and 2 for string data)

2) Choice for operation in generic box
(1- check empty, 2 – is full, 3 – Insert through first entry point, 4 - Insert through last entry point, 5 - Insert through mid entry point6 – Delete through first entry point, 7 - Delete through last entry point, 8 - Delete through mid entry point, 9 -Print, 10 - Exit)

3) For insert options 3, 4 and 5

4) Element to be inserted
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form template for class and form a function g_Box to initiate a generic Box. 
- Form template for class and form isEmpty function and check if first==-1 and mid==-1 and last==-1, return true, otherwise return false.
- Form template for class and form isFull function and check if mid==20 and last==20, return true, otherwise return false.
- Form template for class and form insert_First function to insert data from front of the box.
-  Form template for class and form insert_mid function to insert data from mid of the box.
- Form template for class and form insert_last function to insert data from last of the box.
- Form template for class and form delete_First function to delete data from front of box.
- Form template for class and form delete_mid function to delete data from mid of box.
- Form template for class and form delete_last function to delete data from last of box.
- Form template for class and form print function to print data from the box.
------------------------------------------
