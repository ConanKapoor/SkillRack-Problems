Input for the problem:-

1) Number of rows in matrix1
2) Number of columns in matrix1
3) Element1 in matrix1
    Element2 in matrix1
    ...
    Elementn in matrix1
4) Number of rows in matrix2
5) Number of columns in matrix2
6) Element1 in matrix2
    Element2 in matrix2
   ...
   Elementn in matrix2
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form a template and form a get function to read row and col and the elements of the matrix.
- Form a template and form check_Sparse function to find how many elements have 0 and how many does not and compare them for checking if matrix is sparse.
- Form a template and form add function of matrix type to compute addition of two matrices. 
- Check if row!=m.row and col!=m.col, throw mismatchDimension exception.
- Otherwise, continue with addition.
- Form template an form a print function to print elements of the computed matrix.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

Print elements of resultant matrix or Dimension of matrices do not match if exception is caught

1) Element1 in resultant matrix
    Element2 in resultant matrix
    ...
    Elementn in resultant matrix

2) Matrix is sparse or Matrix is not sparse
