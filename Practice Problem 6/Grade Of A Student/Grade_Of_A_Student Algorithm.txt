ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Form negException function for the exception handling and print "Negaive".
STEP2 - Form moreException function for the exception handling and print "Positive".
STEP3 - Form get function to read data and initialize i as int and read rollno and name.
STEP4 - Iterate through i=0 to 5 and read marks. Check if marks[i]<0, if so, throw negException and if marks[i]>100, throw moreException. At end print Help.
STEP5 - Form print function to print rollno, name and grade.
STEP6 - Form function calc_Avg function and initialize Total=0 as float and i as int. Iterate through i=0 to 5 and calculate total - Total=Total+marks[i]
STEP7 - Calculate average by dividing total by 5.
STEP8 - Form find_grade function and form a if-else ladder to check for grade in respective range.
STEP9 - In main function, in try, form object stud of class student and call get,calc_Avg, find_Grade and print function.
STEP10 - catch negException and moreException.
    CATCH (negException n)
        CALL n.error_Msg()
    CATCH(moreException m)
       CALL  m.error_Msg();
