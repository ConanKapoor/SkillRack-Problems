Input for the problem:-

1) Number of points 'n'
2) value of X- coordinate of point 1
    value of Y- coordinate of point 1
    ...
    value of X- coordinate of point n
    value of Y- coordinate of point n
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Overload >> operator.
- Overload << operator.
- Overload == operator.
- Overload > operator.
- Form sort_Points function of return type void and initialize object swap of class point.
- Perform bubble sort on points to sort them.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1) Print 'n' points in sorted order.
2) value of X- coordinate and Y- coordinate of point1 separated by tab.
    value of X- coordinate and Y- coordinate of point2 separated by tab.
    ....
    value of X- coordinate and Y- coordinate of point n separated by tab.
-------------------------------------------
