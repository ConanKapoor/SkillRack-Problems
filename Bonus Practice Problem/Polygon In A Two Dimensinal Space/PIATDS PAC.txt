Input for the problem:-

1) Next six entries are Vertices of a triangle
2) value of X- coordinate of point1
    value of Y- coordinate of point1
    ....
    value of X- coordinate of point6
    value of Y- coordinate of point6
3) Next eight entries are Vertices of a triangle
4) value of X- coordinate of point1
    value of Y- coordinate of point1
    ....
    value of X- coordinate of point8
    value of Y- coordinate of point8
5) Index in polygon to print
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form point function to initialize x and y as 0.
- Form get function of point class to get x and y coodinates.
- Overload << operator.
- Form what function of outofrange class to print "Out of range".
- Form polygon function to initialize polygon.
- Form destructor of polygon function. In the function, do delete(vertices).
- Form get function of polygon class to read vertices. 
- Overload [] operator.
- Form area function of polygon class to compute area. 
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1) Area of triangle.
2) Area of quadrilateral.
3) Value of X- coordinate and Y- coordinate of point n separated by tab or print Out of range if index is not in range.
