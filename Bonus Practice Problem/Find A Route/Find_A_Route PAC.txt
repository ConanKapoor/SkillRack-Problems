Input for the problem:-

1) Number of cities that are connected to other cities, 'n'.
2) Name of city1.
    Number of neighboring cities for city1, 'm'
    First neighboring city of city1.
    Second neighboring city of city1
    ...
    mth neighboring city of city1
    ...
    Name of city n
    Number of neighboring cities for cityn, 'm'
    First neighboring city of city n
    Second neighboring city of city n
    ...
    mth neighboring city of city n
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form get function to read data about cities. In the function, read num_of_Cities. 
 - Iterate through i=0 to i<num_Of_Cities and read Name_of_City and Num_Of_Neighbours.
- Iterate through j=0 to j<Num_Of_Neighbours and read Name.
- Push back data in city_Connection map.
- Read source and destination.
- Form find_value function of return type bool and return find(ss.begin(),ss.end(),s)==ss.end().
- Form find_Route function of travel class and to find the possible routes.
- Form print_Route function of travel class to print the route.
