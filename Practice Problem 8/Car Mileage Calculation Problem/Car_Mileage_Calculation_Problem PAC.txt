Input for the problem:-

1) Name of the file
2) Input file contains  
    car number, miles driven and gallons  separated by a tab of car1 in line1
car number, miles driven and gallons separated by a tab of car2 in line2
....
car number, miles driven and gallons separated by a tab of carn in linen
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Read Name_of_File.
- Initialize File as fstream.
- Open the File.
- While File.eof is false, input car number, miles_driven and gallons.
- Calculate average by formula - Average=miles_driven/gallons.
- Calculate Total_Miles, Total _average and Total gallons by taking sum.
- Print Car number, miles_driven,gallons and Average for each iteration.
- Print Total_Miles,Total_Gallons,Total_Avg and Total_Avg.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1)car number, miles driven, gallons and mileage of car1 separated by tab
car number, miles driven, gallons and mileage of car2 separated by tab
...
car number, miles driven, gallons and mileage of carn separated by tab
2) Total miles driven
3) total gallons used
4) average miles per gallon for all the cars
