Input for the problem:-

1) Number of points, 'n'
2) Name of tower1
    X-axis of tower1
    Y-axis of tower1
    ...
    Name of towern
    X-axis of towern
    Y-axis of towern
3) Name of mobile
4) X-axis of mobile phone
5) Y-axis of mobile phone
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form get function of point class and read name, x and y.
- Form print function of point class and print name.
- Form distance function of point class to calculate the distance.
- Form get function of mobile class to input data.
- Form compare function to compare 2 points. In the function return p1.dist(mob)<p2.dist(mob).
- Form find_Min function of class mobile to find the minimum distance between mobile and nearest tower.
