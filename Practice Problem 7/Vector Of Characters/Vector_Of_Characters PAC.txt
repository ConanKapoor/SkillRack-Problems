Input for the problem:-

1) String to be stored in vector1.
2) String to be stored in vector2.
---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form function initializeVector of class charVector to input the read string in vector. 
- Form dupVector of class charVector to double the string add in single vector.
- Form dupRevVector of class charVector to double and reverse the string and add in single vector.
- Form print function of class charVector to print the dupVector and dupRevVector.
------------------------------------------
Output for the problem:-

1) Print duplicateVector of vector1.
2) Print duplicateRevVector of vector2.
-------------------------------------------
Solution alternatives:-
