---------------------------------------
Processing involved:-

- Form poly() function and initialize num=20 and terms=new term[20].
- Form poly function with poly& b attribute with num(b.num) as related classes.
- Form poly function with int i attribute with num(i) as related classes and do terms = new term[i].
- Form istream& function to input data.
- Form istream& function to input data related to polynomials.
- Use delete function to empty the array.
- Form ostream& function to print data.
- Form ostream& function to print polynomial coeff and terms.
- Form operator + function -   
- Form operator = function - 
 - Form operator ++ function with int attribute.
- Form operator ++ function with no attribute.(Function overloading.)
