ALGORITHM:-

STEP1 - Include Complex library.
STEP2 - In main function, Intialize and Read R,Im,R1 and Im1.
STEP3 - Initiate A and B as complex.
STEP4 - 	A=R+Im*I;
	        B=R1+Im1*I;
STEP5 - Call functions in main function.
               	  double complex x=addition(A,B);
	          double complex y=subtract(A,B);
	          double complex z=multiply(A,B);
STEP6 - Form print commands for +/- inputs.
STEP7 - Form addition,subtract and multiply functions.
