ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Initialize n,i and Routes=1 as int.
STEP2 - Initialize homecity as string.
STEP3 - Read the value of n.
STEP4 - Initialize city array of length n as string.
STEP5 - Itirate n times and read the name of cities and save in an array.
             for(i=0;i<n;i++)
                {
                cin>>city[i];
                }
STEP6 - Read homecity.
STEP7 - Compute the total number of Routes - 
               for(i=1;i<n;i++)
               {
                     Routes=Routes*i;
               }
STEP8 - Print number of routes.
