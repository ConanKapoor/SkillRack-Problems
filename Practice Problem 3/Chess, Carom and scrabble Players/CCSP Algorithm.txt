ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - In get function, read number of students.
STEP2 - Read name of students.
               for(int i=0;i<num_Of_Ele;i++)
                     cin>>names[i];
STEP3 - In print function, print names of students with comma in between.
               for(int i=0;i<num_Of_Ele;i++)
                    {
                     if(i==0)
                         cout<<names[i];
                     else
                         cout<<","<<names[i];
                     }
                  cout<<"\n";
STEP4 - In intersection function, compute an algorithm to find name of students who play chess and carrom.
STEP5 - initialize set set3;
STEP6 - Initialie k=0,l,m,j as int.
STEP7 - Use strcmp to compare 2 names to find out if 1 student plays chess and carom.
STEP8 - In difference function, compute an algorithm to find name of students who play chess and carrom but not scrabble.
STEP9 - initialize set set3;
STEP10 - Initialie k=0,l,m,j as int.
STEP11 - use strcmp to compare 2 names.
STEP12 - return set3.
