Input for the problem:-

1)Value for ‘m’ - row
2)Value for ‘n’ - column
3)Number of snakes in board
4)Start Grid position of snake1
   End Grid position of snake1
   Start Grid position of snake2
   End Grid position of snake2
   ....for num snakes.
5)Number of ladders in board
6)Start Grid position of ladder1
   End Grid position of ladder1
   Start Grid position of ladder2
   End Grid position of ladder2
7)Current row position of coin of player1
8)Current column position of coin of player1
9)Number of dice rolls
10)Value of roll1
