ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Include Math directory.
STEP2 - Initiate mins,secs,time,fps,mps.
STEP3 - Read mins and secs
STEP4 - Convert mins to seconds.
STEP5 - Round millisecs to nearest second.
STEP6 - Calculate total Time.
STEP7 - Calculate fps and mps.
               fps=5280/Time;
               mps=1609.34/Time;
STEP8- fps=round(fps*100)/100;
       mps=round(mps*100)/100;
STEP9- Print fps,mps.
