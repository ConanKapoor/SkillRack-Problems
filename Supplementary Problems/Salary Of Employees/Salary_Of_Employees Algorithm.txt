ALGORITHM:-
STEP1 - Form a structure with name_of_emp as char, ID as int, HRA,DA,Basic as float.
STEP2 - In main function, initiate i and n as int.
STEP3 - Initialize salary=0 as float.
STEP4 - Read n.
STEP5 - make an array of length n - employee emp[n].
STEP6 - Iterate i from 0 to n, Read name_of_emp, ID, Basic, HRA and DA.
STEP7 - Iterate i from 0 to n, and print emp ID and salary where                   salary=emp[i].Basic*(1+emp[i].HRA/100)+emp[i].DA
